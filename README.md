## MY BE Project 14-02-2022

## SETUP

1. You will need to create two .env files for your project in the root directory with the following names: .env.test and .env.development.

2. Into each, add PGDATABASE=nc_news_test & PGDATABASE=nc_news_development respectively. Double check that these .env files are .gitignored (they'll be greyed out on the directory). If they aren't greyed out please go into the .gitignore file and add the following .env.\*. This should grey out the files you're created.
